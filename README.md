Develop an LSTM-based time series forecasting model to predict future values of the 'Change_COD' variable based on historical data. The model should be trained on a given dataset, and the goal is to accurately predict the values for the test dataset.

## **Model**
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network designed to process sequential data. Unlike traditional neural networks, RNNs have a memory that allows them to remember past information and use it to make predictions or understand the current data point in context. RNNs are often used in tasks like language processing, translation, and speech recognition.
LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. LSTM networks are designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem, which occurs when traditional RNNs struggle to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. The key components of an LSTM network are the memory cell, input gate, forget gate, and output gate.

## **Conclusion**
The LSTM-based time series forecasting model developed in the provided code demonstrates the ability to predict future values of the 'Change_COD' variable based on historical data. The model is trained on a given dataset and evaluated on a separate test dataset.
 
After training the model for 100 epochs, the predictions are made on the test data. The predicted values are then inverse transformed to bring them back to the original scale. These predictions are added to the test dataset and plotted for visualization.
 
The performance of the model is evaluated using two metrics: mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE). The calculated MAE is 7.776855, indicating the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values. The RMSE is 13.051565090663203, representing the square root of the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
 
Overall, the LSTM model demonstrates the ability to capture patterns and trends in the time series data and make reasonable predictions for the future values of the 'Change_COD' variable. However, there is still room for improvement as the errors indicate some deviations from the actual values.

 The LSTM-based time series forecasting model shows promise in predicting future values of the 'Change_COD' variable. Further refinement and experimentation with hyperparameters, architecture, and data preprocessing techniques could potentially enhance the model's accuracy and performance.

In conclusion, building an RNN model with a small dataset presents certain challenges and limitations. The performance of the model may be impacted by the limited amount of data available for training. However, despite these constraints, we have successfully developed an RNN model.

## **Actionable Insights**
Using an equation to predict COD changes in wastewater treatment provides operational, economic, and environmental benefits. It supports process optimization, resource management, compliance monitoring, real-time monitoring, and predictive maintenance, ultimately improving the efficiency and effectiveness of wastewater treatment operations.
By utilising an equation to estimate COD changes, you can:
•	Process optimization: The equation can help optimise the treatment process by providing insights into the expected changes in COD. By understanding how different factors affect COD, such as variations in influent characteristics or treatment conditions, operators can make informed decisions to enhance treatment efficiency.

•	Resource management: Accurate COD predictions allow for better resource allocation.


•	Real-time monitoring: By continuously monitoring influential characteristics and using the equation to estimate COD changes, treatment plants can obtain real-time information about the process performance.
